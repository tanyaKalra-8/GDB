/* John Watson knows of an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers.
One rotation operation moves the last array element to the first position and shifts all remaining 
elements right one. To test the abilities of Sherlock , Watson provides Sherlock with an array of
integers. Sherlock is to perform the rotation operation a number of times then determine 
the value of the element at a given position.

For each array, perform a number of right circular rotations and return the values of the 
elements at the given indices.

Input Format
The first line contains space-separated integers, n, k and q, the number of elements in the integer 
array, the rotation count and the number of queries. The second line contains space-separated 
integers, where each integer i describes array element arr[i] (where 0<=i<n). Each of the
q subsequent lines contains a single integer, queries[i], an index of an element in arr to return.*/
        Scanner sc= new Scanner (System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int k = sc.nextInt();
        int q = sc.nextInt();
        int [] arr = new int [n];
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++){
            arr[i]= sc.nextInt();
        }
        int [] b = new int [n];
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++){
            b[(i+k)%n]= arr[i];
        }
        for (int i=0; i<q; i++){
            int Q = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.println(b[Q]);
        }
